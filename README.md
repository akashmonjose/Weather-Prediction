# Weather Prediction
## About This Project
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze real-world weather data, uncover insights, and build predictive models. It showcases my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, applied to historical weather trends in Seattle.

Weather prediction is a valuable field in data science, and this project highlights how past data can be used to estimate future conditions. It is structured to show my expertise in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling; all essential skills for a data-driven role.

## Why This Project?
I built this project to demonstrate my problem-solving ability and expertise in data science and machine learning. Through this repository, I aim to showcase:

- Data Wrangling: Cleaning and preparing real-world weather data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, seasonality, and patterns in the dataset.
- Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning to forecast weather conditions.
- Visualization & Insights: Communicating findings effectively using charts and graphs.

## Project Files
- Weather Prediction.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, visualizations, and predictive model.
- seattle-weather.csv – The dataset used for training and analysis.

## How It Works
1. Data Cleaning: Prepares the dataset by handling missing values and formatting inconsistencies.
2. Exploratory Analysis: Uses visualizations to understand weather trends over time.
3. Prediction Model: A simple machine learning model estimates future weather conditions.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data processing and modeling.
- Pandas & NumPy for handling and analyzing datasets.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for building a predictive model.
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.

## End Result
The project successfully analyzes Seattle’s historical weather trends and builds a simple machine learning model to predict future weather conditions. The model provides insights into temperature and precipitation patterns, helping to understand how past weather influences future conditions.

## Limitations
- Basic Model: The model is simple and does not incorporate complex weather prediction techniques.
- Limited Features: The dataset may not include external factors like atmospheric pressure or wind patterns, which can improve accuracy.
- Generalization: The model is trained only on Seattle data and may not work well for other locations.
